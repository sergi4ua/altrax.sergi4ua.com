			<p class="artist-align-right-title">DANNY THOMAS SZCZERBINSKI<br></p>
			<p class="artist-align-right-p">Polish music producer. He began his musical activity in 2011. He mainly dealt with remixes of well-known music groups such as "E nomine" and "Enigma".
In 2015, he started to produce and compose his own music. He founded his first fully original music project called "D.U.O.M.O.X." The project has five albums and became famous on the network thanks to the songs: "Dunkelhait" "Eclipse" "Soone Energy". In 2017, he published music under artistic pseudonyms: "V-T.B.S." "TraumMechanik" "Dream Zone" "Dj SkyTanzer & Nibelungen" "NachtRhytmus". He has compiled such as: "Electronic Revolution Zone" "Interlude Mix Tape" "Future Zodiak". In 2019 he joined forces with the vocalist and producer Daro Songero and founded a music project in the style of Synth-Pop called "Dutsch X-Press".
In the meantime, he produces music under his own name and, in fact, it is its extension.</p>

			<p class="artist-align-right-title">MAX CEGIELKA<br></p>
			<p class="artist-align-right-p">The sound I try to achieve is a mix of dark electro, ambient, house, uplifting trance, chiptune, glitch and early 2010's dubstep. To put it shortly - complextro - a very complex subgenre of electro. I compose my music in short impulses of creativity and passion, trying to send a message of my support for individualism, anthropocentrism and transhumanism - and to make the listener feel some deeper emotions I personally call "endless human ambition" (lol). Nearly all of the tracks I produce contain about 30 layers of different instruments. They're usually a set of detuned, echoed pads, which serve as a background; topped with constantly changing percussion (while still being rhytmic) and synths in form of wobble bass interchanging with supersaw stabs; "sprinkled" with 8bit sounds. It's organized chaos.</p>
